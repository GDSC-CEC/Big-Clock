# Hacktoberfest 2023 Beginner Repository

## What is Hacktoberfest üéâ

**[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** is an annual open-source celebration encouraging global developers to contribute four quality contributions to open projects during October. Hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/ten-years-hacktoberfest) and [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest-2023), it fosters collaboration, offers swag rewards, and promotes open-source values, creating a vibrant community and enhancing coding skills.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository to create your copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Big-Clock
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your contributions. Branch names should be descriptive, like `feature/new-code` or `fix/bug-fix`. You can create a branch using the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make Your Contribution**: You can add new code snippets, improve existing ones, or work on any issues or tasks listed in the repository.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made your changes, commit them using clear and concise commit messages. This helps maintain a clean commit history. Here's an example:


6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Provide a clear title and description for your PR, and ensure that you're comparing your branch to the correct base branch.

8. **Wait for Review**: Contributors and maintainers will review your PR, suggest changes if necessary, and eventually merge it once it meets the project's standards.

## Contribution Tips üí°

- Make sure your code is well-documented, following the appropriate conventions for the language you are using.
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
- If you are adding a new feature or making significant changes, consider opening an issue to discuss the change first.
